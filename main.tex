\section{Radiance Cascades}
As previously discussed, \acrlong{rc} was developed to simulate global illumination in realtime for computer graphics applications.
The method is built upon the following simple principle: Near a source, the radiance field varies rapidly in space, but not in angle. 
Far from the source, the radiance field varies slowly in space but rapidly in angle. 
There are, of course, caveats to this generalization, and the point of the proposed work is to explore cases where these assumptions hold or deteriorate.
In this section, we provide an overview of the theory presented in papers by Sannikov and Osborne~\cite{osborneRadianceCascadesNovel2025a,sannikovRadianceCascadesNovela} with some additional preliminary theory for the method as it pertains to neutron transport.

\subsection{Radiance Intervals}
This section introduces and derives the concept of radiance intervals in a neutron transport framework.
