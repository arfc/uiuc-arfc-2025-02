Another industry that is interested in solving transport problems is computer graphics, especially in the world of video game development.
The developers of these games are interested not only in the accuracy of solutions (though perhaps arguably not as much as nuclear scientists), but also in the speed at which those solutions are achieved, oftentimes restricted to ``realtime,'' or near-instantaneous.
There are additional applications seen in rendering for animation and computer-generated imagery (CGI) in movie-making, which have been fortunate to have the financial resources to invest in top-of-the-line computational resources; however, this paper will focus on a particular application of photon transport methodology developed by game developers.
