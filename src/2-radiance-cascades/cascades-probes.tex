\subsection{Radiance Probes and Cascades}
This section formally defines radiance probes and radiance cascades, demonstrating how the radiation field about a given point is solved for. 
To do so, we utilize our previously derived radiance intervals~(\cref{eq:beta-and-rad-interval}) and the interval merging relation~(\cref{eq:rad-interval-merging}) to solve the radiation field naively. 
Then, we present the main result of \glspl{rc}, which enables significantly more efficient encoding of the radiation field by taking advantage of the key observations of the penumbra criterion. 
Finally, we desribe the cascade merging algorithm, which efficiently solves for the radiation field throughout the problem domain.
