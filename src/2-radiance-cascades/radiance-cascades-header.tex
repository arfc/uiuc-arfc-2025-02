As previously discussed, \acrlong{rcs} was developed to simulate global illumination in real time for computer-graphics applications.
The method is built upon the following principle: near a source, the radiance field varies rapidly in space but only weakly in angle.
Far from the source, the radiance field varies slowly in space but rapidly in angle.
There are, of course, caveats to this generalization, and the aim of the proposed work is to explore cases where these assumptions hold and deteriorate.
In this section, we provide an overview of the theory presented in the papers by Sannikov and Osborne~\cite{sannikovRadianceCascadesNovel,osborneSimpleRayAcceleration2025}, along with preliminary extensions of the method as it pertains to neutron transport.
