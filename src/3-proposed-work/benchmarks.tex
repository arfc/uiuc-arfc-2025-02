\subsection{Benchmarks}
Benchmark cases for \glspl{rc} must be chosen to specifically show the advantages of the method and directly test for known problems in other methods, such as ray-effects in \glspl{sn}.
To be considered successful, we will need to implement \glspl{rc} in such a way that not only converges to the correct solution, but can also do so faster than proven methods such as \glspl{sn}.
Or, alternatively, must be proven to scale well using GPU parallelism.
We propose the following benchmark cases be used for the development and testing of \glspl{rc}.

The application of \glspl{rc} to the \glspl{bte} has been largely proven by Osborne and Sannikov~\cite{osborneRadianceCascadesNovel2025}, though with a particular application to photon transport in astrophysics.
There are two main differences between this application and ours:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Neutron transport simulations are typically focused on length scales in the centimeters to meters, not kilometers and light-years.\label{first difference}
    \item The source term is dependent on the flux in multiplying (fission) media.\label{second difference}
\end{enumerate}

\Cref{first difference} will be straightforward to show, as there are many benchmarks that allow for testing neutron streaming.
One such set, known as the Kobayashi benchmarks~\cite{kobayashi3DRADIATIONRANSPORT2000}, has become an industry standard and has been used consistently in modern codes, such as the \glspl{sn} code Denovo from Oak Ridge National Laboratory~\cite{evansDenovoNewThreeDimensional2010b}.
They look to test streaming through voids from a fixed source into a non-multiplying material.

These benchmarks consist of three geometries:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A source surrounded by a cubic void (\cref{fig:first-kobayashi}).
    \item A source with a vertical (chimney-like) void (\cref{fig:second-kobayashi}).
    \item A source with a ``dog leg''\footnote{Yes, that is the actual name in the paper.} void duct (\cref{fig:third-kobayashi}).
\end{enumerate}

The surrounding non-void region is either strictly absorbing or 50\% absorbing with 50\% scattering (of the total cross section).
Values for these cases can be found in \cref{tab:kobayashi-source-and-mat-props}.

The ultimate goal will be to report on \glspl{rc}'s capabilities on the 3D problems as they were originally published.
However, we will propose to start with 2D ``flattened'' versions of these problems for a proof-of-concept internally, then move on to 3D implementation.

\Cref{second difference}, however, is the more interesting and relevant problem to tackle for a proof-of-concept.
One of the most well-known benchmarks for this is the C5G7 benchmark case, which models a simplified, reflected quarter-core reactor with mixed-oxide and uranium-oxide fuel.
The core is moderated with water.
As described in~\cite{BenchmarkDeterministicTransport2005}, this problem looks to challenge codes' abilities to handle spatial heterogeneity.
A general schematic of this benchmark has been given in \cref{fig:c5g7-general}, and we refer the reader to the Nuclear Energy Agency report~\cite{BenchmarkDeterministicTransport2005} for specifics.
One advantage to choosing this benchmark is the ability to expand to time-dependent testing, as development is currently underway for this extension~\cite{DeterministicTimeDependentNeutron}.

    \label{fig:c5g7-general}
\end{figure}

The implementation of C5G7 requires a mostly-mature code to implement, with the major challenges being:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 3D implementation.
    \item Complicated geometry.
    \item Multiple materials.
    \item Varying length scales (ex. between pincells vs. from assemble to vacuum boundary).
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, we propose to first create test problems using OpenMC or MCNP6 with multiplying media and simple geometry.
This will allow for the development and refinement of source iteration methods.
Then, we will build up to more complicated geometries, finally arriving at the C5G7 benchmark, which will be reported on and published.

To sum up: We look to test both the streaming and source capabilities of \acrlong{rc} using the Kobayashi and C5G7 benchmarks, respectively.
The Kobayashi benchmarks have simplified 2D forms that more-readily allow for preliminary testing than C5G7, so we advocate for additional test problems to precede C5G7.
