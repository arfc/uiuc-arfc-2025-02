\subsection{Formalization of the Penumbra Criteria}
% Liam
As discussed in \cref{subsec:penumbra-criterion}, the penumbra criteria was originally formulated for global illumination problems in video game development.
As such, the motivations for its formulation differ from those in the scientific community.
That is, greater emphasis is placed on the \textit{speed} of the algorithm, rather than the numerical accuracy. 
This is clearly seen in the penumbra criteria, which lacks rigor in its definition.
Indeed, though initial papers by Sannikov and Osborne acknowledge the proportionality of the required step size needed in the angular and spatial discretizations, neither attempt to describe additional constraints to the requirements; both papers simply assume a coefficient of 1 and claim that this holds generally.
As part of this work, we propose to formalize the penumbra criteria so that the \acrshort{rcs} technique and its limitations are clearly understood.
