\subsection{Acceleration Methods}
There are various methods employed in deterministic neutron transport methods for convergence acceleration that could be used for \acrshort{rcs}.
Specific methods we think would be interesting to investigate are \gls{cmfd}, \gls{dsa}, and \gls{tsa}.
\gls{cmfd} has already been used for \gls{moc} codes (and is implemented in OpenMOC and OpenMC) and has proven to be a great accelerator.
\gls{dsa} is a super effective method for accelerating source iteration, but is only effective for highly diffusive problems/regions.
\gls{tsa} is a more robust method for accelerating source iteration, is well suited for highly anisotropic scattering problems/regions and sparse/void/near-void problems and regions; at added computational cost compared to DSA.
