\subsection{Acceleration Methods}
There are various methods employed in deterministic neutron transport methods for convergence acceleration that could be used for \acrshort{rcs}.
Specific methods we think would be interesting to investigate are \acrshort{cmfd}, \acrshort{dsa}, and \acrshort{tsa}.
\acrshort{cmfd} has already been used for \acrshort{moc} codes (and is implemented in OpenMOC and OpenMC) and has proven to be a great accelerator.
\acrshort{dsa} is a super effective method for accelerating source iteration, but is only effective for highly diffusive problems/regions.
Additionally, \acrshort{dsa} has not been formalized for \acrshort{moc}, as MOC is an angular discretization technique and Diffusion has no angular dependence.
\acrshort{tsa} is a more robust method for accelerating source iteration, is well suited for highly anisotropic scattering problems/regions and sparse/void/near-void problems and regions; at added computational cost compared to DSA.
