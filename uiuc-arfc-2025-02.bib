The PDEs are widely used in science and engineering to model physical systems and processes. Such equations are often complex, difficult and/or highly impractical to solve analytically. Although several methods exist to approximate solutions for PDEs, employing an approach that is both computationally -- resourceful and reliable is crucial in particular to engineering fields of importance to creating reliable and safe designs of the systems involved. This paper introduces and expounds upon the MOC, a method by which PDE solutions are converged quickly and accurately as compared to alternative methods. The MOC theory is described with a few study cases in showing a step-by-step solution for each. Its detailed application to neutron transport, thermal hydraulics and conductivity imaging are presented.},

Denovo uses the Koch-Baker-Alcouffe parallel sweep algorithm to obtain high parallel efficiency on O(100) processors on XYZ orthogonal meshes. As opposed to traditional SN codes that use source iteration, Denovo uses nonstationary Krylov methods to solve the within-group equations. Krylov methods are far more efficient than stationary schemes. Additionally, classic acceleration schemes (diffusion synthetic acceleration) do not suffer stability problems when used as a preconditioner to a Krylov solver. Denovo's generic programming framework allows multiple spatial discretization schemes and solution methodologies. Denovo currently provides diamond-difference, theta-weighted diamond-difference, linear-discontinuous finite element, trilinear-discontinuous finite element, and step characteristics spatial differencing schemes. Also, users have the option of running traditional source iteration instead of Krylov iteration. Multigroup upscatter problems can be solved using Gauss-Seidel iteration with transport, two-grid acceleration. A parallel first-collision source is also available. Denovo solutions to the Kobayashi benchmarks are in excellent agreement with published results. Parallel performance shows excellent weak scaling up to 20000 cores and good scaling up to 40000 cores.},

  abstract = {Efficiently calculating global illumination has always been one of the greatest challenges in computer graphics. Algorithms for approximating global illumination have always struggled to run in realtime for fully dynamic scenes, and have had to rely heavily on stochastic raytracing, spatialtemporal denoising, or undersampled representations, resulting in much lower quality of lighting compared to reference solutions. Even though the problem of calculating global illumination in 2D is significantly simpler than that of 3D, most contemporary approaches still struggle to accurately approximate 2D global illumination under realtime constraints. We present Holographic Radiance Cascades: a new single-shot scene-agnostic radiance transfer algorithm for global illumination, which is capable of achieving results visually indistinguishable from the 2D reference solution at realtime framerates. Our method uses a multi-level radiance probe system, and computes rays via combining short ray intervals as a replacement for conventional raytracing. It runs at constant cost for a given scene size, taking 1.85ms for a 512x512 pixel image and 7.67ms for 1024x1024 on an RTX 3080 Laptop.},

  author = {Ganapol, Barry},
  year = 2008,
  abstract = {The developers of computer codes involving neutron transport theory for nuclear engineering applications seldom apply analytical benchmarking strategies to ensure the quality of their programs. A major reason for this is the lack of analytical benchmarks and their documentation in the literature. The few such benchmarks that do exist are difficult to locate, as they are scattered throughout the neutron transport and radiative transfer literature. The motivation for this benchmark compendium, therefore, is to gather several analytical benchmarks appropriate for nuclear engineering applications under one cover. We consider the following three subject areas: neutron slowing down and thermalization without spatial dependence, one-dimensional neutron transport in infinite and finite media, and multidimensional neutron transport in a half-space and an infinite medium. Each benchmark is briefly described, followed by a detailed derivation of the analytical solution representation. Finally, a demonstration of the evaluation of the solution representation includes qualified numerical benchmark results. All accompanying computer codes are suitable for the PC computational environment and can serve as educational tools for courses in nuclear engineering. While this benchmark compilation does not contain all possible benchmarks, by any means, it does include some of the most prominent ones and should serve as a valuable reference.},

  abstract = {The focus of this thesis is on the development of a highly scalable parallel algorithm for solving the 3-D method of characteristics (MOC) form of the Boltzmann neutron transport equation. The derivation of the 3-D MOC method is presented first, along with the details of the discretization techniques, that utilize the concept of modular ray tracing. The implementation of these equations is then described, and then the approach to parallelizing the algorithm is discussed. Results are shown for a range of benchmark problems typically solved by 3-D neutron transport codes. The algorithm is parallelized in space, angle, and by characteristic rays, which is specific to the MOC solution method. Once the parallel algorithm is established, a performance model for the particular implementation is derived. This model contains detailed expressions for the number of floating point operations and execution time as a function of the problem size and fundamental computer hardware properties, such as the time per flop and cache access latency. The procedure for determining the hardware coefficients required by the performance model is then presented and validated using experimental results. The performance model is shown to agree well with experiment for both types of execution, and the model is therefore used for subsequent analyses that explore the algorithm's sensitivities to the computer and network hardware characteristics. The model is also analyzed to assess the scaling of the algorithm for a quarter core PWR. The optimization of the convergence of the parallel 3-D MOC algorithm through the use of the coarse mesh finite difference (CMFD) method is then developed. The CMFD accelerated parallel 3-D MOC algorithm is then used to compute solutions to several numerical benchmarks, that show good agreement with the reference results. Finally, the research performed in this thesis and its conclusions are summarized, and areas of future research are suggested.},

  abstract = {Non-LTE radiative transfer is a key tool for modern astrophysics: it is the means by which many key synthetic observables are produced, thus connecting simulations and observations. The default approach for computing the radiation field in multidimensional solar radiative transfer models has long remained the same: a short characteristics, discrete ordinates method, formal solver. In situations with complex atmospheric structure and multiple transitions between optically thick and thin regimes these solvers require prohibitively high angular resolution to correctly resolve the radiation field. Here, we present the theory of radiance cascades, a technique designed to exploit structure inherent to the radiation field, allowing for efficient reuse of calculated samples, thus providing a very high-resolution result at a fraction of the computational cost of existing methods. We additionally describe our implementation of this method in the DexRT code, and present initial results of the synthesis of a snapshot of a magnetohydrodynamic model of a solar prominence formed via levitation-condensation, along with comparison against short characteristics solutions. The approach presented here provides a credible route for routinely performing multidimensional radiative transfer calculations free from so-called ray effects, and scaling high-quality non-LTE models to next-generation high-performance computing systems with GPU accelerators.},

We introduce a variance-limited mipmapping (VLM) scheme with tunable error control, and extend it to handle anisotropic emission via two methods: velocity interpolation, and so-called "Core and Voigt". Our approach integrates a hierarchical digital differential analyzer (HDDA) for efficient ray traversal, which, combined with the mipmapping scheme achieves an order of magnitude speedup with less than 0.5 \% error in the 99.9th percentile of the level populations. These methods are implemented in the DexRT code and demonstrate significant performance gains in realistic solar atmospheric models.},

The idea of radiance cascades relies on an observation, that in order to resolve radiance emitted by an object, one needs to have higher linear resolution next to it, and higher angular resolution farther away from it. Radiance cascades exhibit a distinctly unique way of asymptotic scaling that for all practical purposes is equivalent to casting infinitely many rays in a finite amount of time, while using a finite amount of memory. This highly unusual property allows to effectively remove the total number of rays as the primary constraint for calculating global illumination in 2d and 3d.},
